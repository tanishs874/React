- State management (react don't have state management)
-- redux,redux toolkit, zustand, context API
- Class based component -- legacy code 
-- BAAS(backend as a service) apps - social media clone , e commerce app

- After react - React is not a complete solution in most case -- no seo, browser render of js , no routing
-framework - next JS , Gatsby , Remix



--- Can  i use react without a framework ???
-- Yes , we can use vite or parcel bundler for that--- 
-- what is a bundler??
- bundler combines all the javascript files and provides us one basic file through which all the work is done


- for mobile apps -- react + react native
- for browser web related works --- react + react-dom
